# eyepatch
Hides away Leetcode's Difficulty and Acceptance Rate columns. But will show you those information after you pass a problem right below the "Accepted" text.

Open Extensions tab in chrome, click "load unpacked extension...", choose the root folder and you're good to go.

It's also available on chrome store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/leetcode-eye-patch/jmpkmcogglidbaggbahfidgcpjmeeomn

## Current issue
solved--Hides away the "Accepted" text when submitting a problem.
UI too simple.

Feel free to contribute in any way!
